# Problem statement

Data points $Y_1, Y_2, \dots, Y_n$ coming from a **mixture model**:
$$
  Y_i \sim^{i.i.d.} \sum_{j=1}^n w_j N(\mu_j, \varepsilon^2).
$$
\pause

**What does this mean?**\pause

For every data point:\pause

- let $Z_i$ be a random variable such that $\mathbb{P}(Z_i = j) = w_j$ for $j=1,2,3$,\pause
- let $Y_i \mid Z_i \sim N(\mu_{Z_i}, \varepsilon^2)$.
